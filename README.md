Hello Everyone! Welcome to Space-shooter!
This is a straight forward space shooting game where the task of user ship is to destroy all the enemy before they reach the earth. You need both the backend and the front end parts to be able to play the game locally.

Download the frontend part here

```
clone this repo
cd space-shooter-backend
run rails server

```
Then go to the frontend part and follow the next instruction.
Thank you for using my app and any contribution will be appreciated.
